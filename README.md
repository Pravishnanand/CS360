**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The inventory app I developed aimed to address the needs of businesses and organizations looking to efficiently manage their stock and assets. Its primary goal was to provide a user-friendly platform for users to keep track of inventory levels, monitor product availability, and streamline the procurement process. The app aimed to reduce manual data entry, minimize errors, and enhance overall inventory management.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

The app featured screens and features essential for inventory management, including product cataloging, barcode scanning, inventory tracking, and reporting. The UI designs prioritized simplicity and ease of use, ensuring that users could quickly add, update, or remove items from their inventory. User-centric design elements, such as intuitive navigation and clear labeling, made it straightforward for users to manage their inventory effectively.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

In coding the app, I followed the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) to create reusable classes and maintainable code. The use of Java and Android Studio facilitated the development process. Techniques such as data binding and room database were employed to efficiently manage data and enhance the overall user experience. These strategies can be applied in future app development projects to ensure code quality and maintainability.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

Rigorous testing was conducted throughout the development process to ensure the app's functionality. This included testing data synchronization, barcode scanning accuracy, and inventory calculations. Thorough testing is crucial to identify and rectify issues that could lead to inventory discrepancies or operational inefficiencies, ultimately providing users with a reliable tool for inventory management.

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

One area of innovation in the app's development was the integration of barcode scanning technology. Overcoming the challenge of implementing a fast and accurate barcode scanner required innovative solutions and research into third-party libraries. This feature significantly improved inventory data entry speed and accuracy, reducing manual errors.

**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

I consider the barcode scanning and inventory tracking components of the mobile app to be a demonstration of my knowledge, skills, and experience. Implementing these features effectively required a deep understanding of mobile hardware capabilities, data management, and user interface design. The successful integration of barcode scanning technology showcased my ability to leverage advanced features to create a practical and user-friendly inventory management solution.
